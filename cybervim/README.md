# cybervim
An opinionated configuration for neovim

This repository was created out of a need to better manage my neovim
configuration that simply could not be fufilled by using my [dotfiles
repo.](https://github.com/ahoodatheguy/dotfiles)

Because of this, the configuration is specifically tweaked to *my* liking. So
don't come crying if something isn't done the way you like it, because chances
are i'm not gonna change it. (looking at you, space users)

Luckily, I try to design the folder structure to be easy to navigate, so
changing it yourself shouldn't be a problem.
